# TermsScheduler
TermsScheduler is a web application that lets students sign up for subjects and particular terms.

Its full design has yet to be defined, but probably it will be made from three parts:

* frontend made in AngularJS (tbd)
* backend - REST Api made in Flask
* ant colony optimization algorithm written in C and scripted in Perl (this part *might* get rewritten because it is old and not so maintainable)

The backend part will be written for an university course "Advanced Web Technologies" at AGH University of Science and Technology.
