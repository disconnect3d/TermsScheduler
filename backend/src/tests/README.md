# Tests

The tests are written in [`pytest`](http://pytest.org/), 
a full-featured testing tool which doesn't enforce you to write a lot of boilerplate.

As we are using Flask, this is also enhanced by [`pytest-flask`](http://pytest-flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module,
which adds useful [fixtures](http://pytest-flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#fixtures) available in your tests.
